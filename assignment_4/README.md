Solar System
============
This directory contains the framework code that will be used in the four OpenGL exercises.

Building under Linux/macOS
--------------------------
Inside the exercise's top-level directory, execute the following commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

The last command -- i.e. `make` -- compiles the application. Rerun it whenever you have added/changed code in order to recompile.

Building under Windows Visual Studio
------------------------------------
  * Install Visual Studio Community 2013 or later
  * You will be asked, if you want to install additional packages. Make sure that you check the c++ development option.
  * Inside the exercise's top-level directory create a new `build` folder (CTRL + SHIFT + N)
  * Install [CMake] (https://cmake.org/download/)
  * Start the cmake-gui.exe
  * Click `Browse Source` and select the exercise's top-level directory
  * Click `Browse Build` and select the created `build` folder
  * Click `Configure` and select your Visual Studio version
  * Start Configuring. 
  * If no major errors occur, click `Generate`
  * Start Visual Studio
  * Use `Open Project` to load your `SolarSystem.sln`
  * On the right, there should be the solution explorer. Find the project `SolarViewer`, right click and choose `Set as StartUp Project`
  * Press CTRL + F5 to compile and run

Documentation
-------------
You may build an HTML documentation as long as you have [Doxygen](www.doxygen.org/) installed. To do so, still inside the directory `build`, execute the following command:

    make doc

View the documentation by opening the file `html/index.html` with any web browser / HTML viewer. If you are into LaTeX, navigate into the directory `latex` and execute the command `make` to create a printable version of the documentation.

Textures and Copyright
----------------------
All earth textures are from the [NASA Earth Observatory](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/) and have been modified by Prof. Hartmut Schirmacher, Beuth Hochschule f√ºr Technik Berlin. The sun texture is from http://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures. All other textures are from http://textures.forrest.cz/index.php?spgmGal=maps&spgmPic=14. The ship model if from https://free3d.com.

Keyboard Settings
-----------------
  * arrow keys: Navigation Camera
  * W,A,S,D:	Navigation Ship
  * g:		toggle greyscale
  * +/-:	increase/decrease time_step
  * y/z:	switch mono/stereo view mode
  * 1-6:	set camera to planets/sun
  * 7:		set camera to ship
  * 8/9:	change camera's distance to the observed object
  * space:	pause 
  * r:		randomize planets' positions
  * escape:	exit viewer
  
Assignment 4: OpenGL Hello World
--------------------------------
Your only task for the OpenGL part of Assignment 4 is to make sure the OpenGL
exercise framework code builds and runs on your machine. Please submit a
screenshot of the "Solar System" window running on your machine. Refer to the
assignment handout PDF on Moodle for an example of what you should see if
everything is working properly.
