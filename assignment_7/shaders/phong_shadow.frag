    /** \todo
    * Compute this light's diffuse and specular contributions.
    * You should be able to copy your phong lighting code from assignment 6 mostly as-is,
    * though notice that the light and view vectors need to be computed from scratch
    * here; this time, they are not passed from the vertex shader.
    *
    * The light should only contribute to this fragment if the fragment is not occluded
    * by another object in the scene. You need to check this by comparing the distance
    * from the fragment to the light against the distance recorded for this
    * light ray in the shadow map.
    *
    * To prevent "shadow acne" and minimize aliasing issues, we need a rather large
    * tolerance on the distance comparison. It's recommended to use a *multiplicative*
    * instead of additive tolerance: compare the fragment's distance to 1.01x the
    * distance from the shadow map.
