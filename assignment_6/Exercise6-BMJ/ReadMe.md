 * Phong lighting model: The code itself was fairly easy to implement (as we already did it before), but it was hard to figure out what we should do exactly with the code and how to use it in combination with solar_viewr.cpp. at first we didn't normalize a vector, so we got an interesting scene (look at wrong_phong imgage).

 * Shading the Earth: it just took some time to adjust everything, it was never quite right (look at wrong_earth image), until we managed to fix everything. At some point we mixed the textures assigning the wrong number, so the night texture was on when the sun was shining.

Have a nice day/night!
