Everything but rules given, rules should match the iterations in the assignment_8.pdf

left_plant system
Iterations n = 7 
Rotation angle d = 60? 
Initial state: s0 = F
Rules: Close but not quite; F=F[+F]F

crossout system
Iterations n = 4 
Rotation angle d = 90? 
Initial state: s0 = F + F + F + F
Rules: F=F-FF+F+FF-F

hexerode system 
Iterations n = 4 
Rotation angle d = 60? 
Initial state: s0 = -F + F + F + F + F + F
Rules: ?

flower_plant system
Iterations n = 7 
Rotation angle d = 120? 
Initial state: s0 = T
Rules:
